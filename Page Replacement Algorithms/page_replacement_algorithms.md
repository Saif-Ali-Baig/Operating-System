# üîÑ Page Replacement Algorithms in C

This repository contains a collection of C programs designed to simulate page replacement algorithms, including **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** and **Least Recently Used (LRU)**. These programs were developed to understand how operating systems manage memory by deciding which pages to swap out when memory is full.

By implementing these algorithms, I aimed to gain practical experience with memory management and its impact on system performance.

## üéØ Purpose and Learning Objectives

The primary goal of this project was to learn about page replacement algorithms and their implementation. Specifically, I wanted to:

- Understand the mechanics of **FIFO** and **LRU** page replacement algorithms.
- Analyze metrics like **page faults** and their impact on system performance.
- Explore trade-offs between **simplicity** and **efficiency** in memory management.
- Develop skills in simulating memory management algorithms using **C**.
- Gain insights into the design of **virtual memory systems** in operating systems.

These programs provide a practical introduction to page replacement, bridging theoretical concepts with real-world applications.

## üìÇ Programs Overview

Below is a summary of the programs included in this repository, each simulating a specific page replacement algorithm:

### 1. First-In-First-Out (FIFO)

- **Purpose:** Replaces the oldest page in memory when a new page is needed.  
- **Learning Outcome:** Demonstrates a simple but potentially inefficient page replacement strategy.

### 2. Least Recently Used (LRU)

- **Purpose:** Replaces the page that has not been used for the longest time.  
- **Learning Outcome:** Shows a more efficient strategy that tracks page usage history.

## ‚ùì Why These Programs?

These programs were created to:

- **Learn by Doing:** Simulating page replacement algorithms provided hands-on experience with memory management.
- **Compare Algorithms:** Implementing FIFO and LRU helped understand their performance differences.
- **Improve C Programming Skills:** Working with arrays and time-tracking mechanisms enhanced my proficiency in C.
- **Build a Foundation for Memory Management:** These simulations lay the groundwork for studying advanced memory management techniques.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- Each program is stored in a separate `.c` file (e.g., `fifo_page_replacement.c`, `lru_page_replacement.c`).
- The programs are designed to be compiled and run on UNIX-like systems (e.g., Linux, macOS).
- File names are descriptive to indicate the algorithm implemented.
