# üîê Process Synchronization and Deadlock Avoidance in C

This repository contains a collection of C programs designed to explore **process synchronization** and **deadlock avoidance** techniques. The programs cover classical synchronization problems (Dining Philosophers, Producer-Consumer, Readers-Writers) and the **Banker's Algorithm** for deadlock avoidance.

These programs were developed to understand how to manage shared resources and prevent deadlocks in multi-process systems.  
By implementing them, I aimed to gain practical experience with synchronization mechanisms and resource allocation strategies in UNIX-like systems.

## üéØ Purpose and Learning Objectives

The primary goal of this project was to learn about process synchronization and deadlock avoidance. Specifically, I wanted to:

- Understand how to use **semaphores** and **mutexes** to synchronize processes and threads
- Explore solutions to **classical synchronization problems**
- Learn the **Banker's Algorithm** for safe resource allocation
- Develop skills in managing **concurrent access** to shared resources
- Gain insights into preventing and avoiding **deadlocks** in operating systems

These programs provide a practical foundation for studying **concurrent programming** and **resource management**.

## üìÇ Programs Overview

Below is a summary of the programs included in this repository, each focusing on a specific synchronization or deadlock avoidance technique:

### 1. Dining Philosophers

- **Purpose**: Simulates philosophers sharing resources (chopsticks) to avoid deadlock and starvation  
- **Learning Outcome**: Demonstrates semaphore-based synchronization to manage shared resources

### 2. Producer-Consumer

- **Purpose**: Models producers adding items to a buffer and consumers removing them  
- **Learning Outcome**: Shows how to use semaphores and mutexes for bounded buffer synchronization

### 3. Readers-Writers

- **Purpose**: Manages multiple readers and writers accessing a shared resource  
- **Learning Outcome**: Illustrates priority-based synchronization to prevent writer starvation

### 4. Banker's Algorithm

- **Purpose**: Ensures safe resource allocation to avoid deadlocks  
- **Learning Outcome**: Demonstrates how to check for a safe state in resource allocation
